# Evaluating Multiple Conditions

* As a developer, I want to create a function that will take in two conditions and determine whether both conditions are `true`, only one condition is `true`, or both conditions are `false`.

## Acceptance Criteria

* It's done when the message "Condition1 ✅ Condition2 ✅" is logged when both `conditionA` and `conditionB` are true.

* It's done when the message "Condition1 ✅ Condition2 ❌" is logged when `conditionA` is true and `conditionB` is false.

* It's done when the message "Condition1 ❌ Condition2 ✅" is logged when `conditionA` is false and `conditionB` is true.

* It's done when the message "Condition1 ❌ Condition2 ❌" is logged when both `conditionA` and `conditionB` are false.
