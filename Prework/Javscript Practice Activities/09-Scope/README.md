# Fix Undefined Variables Causing Console Log Errors

Resolve the following issue(s):

* As a developer, I want to log messages to the console using variables declared in both global and local scope.

## Expected Behavior

When the console is opened, a series of messages should log to the console.

## Actual Behavior

When the console is opened, an error message indicates that at least one variable is undefined, and messages do not log.

## ðŸ’¡ Hints

Think about how the variable is being used. Is it being made available to all functions, or is it only being used by one function?
