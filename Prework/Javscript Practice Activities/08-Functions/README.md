# üîç Compare Two Numbers for Equality

Implement the following user story:

* As a developer, I want to determine if two numbers are equal to each other.

## Acceptance Criteria

* It's done when I provide two numbers as function arguments and the function checks their equality.

* It's done if, when the numbers are strictly equal, the message "The numbers are equal in type and value" is logged.

* It's done if, when the numbers are equal but not strictly equal, the message "The numbers are equal in value" is logged.

* It's done if, when the numbers are neither equal nor strictly equal, the message "The numbers are not equal" is logged.

* It's done if, when the `isEqual` function is rewritten as a function expression and when called with numbers that are not equal or strictly equal, the message "The numbers are not equal" is logged.

## üí° Hints

How can we use parameters to give a name to the two numbers that we want to evaluate with the function?
