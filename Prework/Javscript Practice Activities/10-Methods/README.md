# Utilize Array and String Methods

Implement the following user stories:

* As a developer, I want to use array methods to add and remove elements from an array and merge two arrays.

* As a developer, I want to use a string method to return a new string that contains only lowercase letters.

## Acceptance Criteria

* It's done when the string `"Orion"` is added as the first element of the `stars` array and no elements are removed.

* It's done when `"Mars"` is removed from the `planets` array.

* It's done when the arrays `stars` and `planets` are merged to form a new array named `universe`. The arrays `stars` and `planets` should not be altered.

* It's done when the string `"SIRIUS"` is converted into all lowercase letters and the new string is stored in a variable.
