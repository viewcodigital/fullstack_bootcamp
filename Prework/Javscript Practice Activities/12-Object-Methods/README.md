# 🐱🐶 Log Pet Availability to Console

Resolve the following issue(s):

* Users should see a message log to the console indicating whether the shelter's dog or cat is available.

## Expected Behavior

When a name is stored in the `selectedPet` variable, a message should log to the console indicating the name stored in `selectedPet`. The message should also indicate whether the pet is a dog or a cat and indicate the availability of the dog or cat. If the pet is unavailable, display a message suggesting the shelter's featured animal, which is the first listed cat or dog.

## Actual Behavior

No message is logged to the console, and an error message indicating an `Uncaught ReferenceError` is returned.

## 💡 Hints

Look at each console log. What is the intended input? How can you use the object name and key to access the values and methods you need to make the code work?
