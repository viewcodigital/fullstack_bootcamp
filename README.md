## **Prework Structure**

The prework is organized into several key components:

1. **Javascript Fundamentals**: This section, found in `Javascript.md`, covers essential JavaScript concepts you'll need throughout the course. It includes topics like variables, data types, functions, and more.

2. **Practice Activities**: Located in the `Javascript Practice Activities` folder, these exercises will help you apply what you've learned. Each activity focuses on a specific concept:

   - Arrays (06-Stu_Arrays)
   - Conditional Statements (05-Conditional-Statements)
   - Iteration and Loops (07-Iteration_Loops)
   - Scope (09-Scope)

   Each activity folder contains a README.md file with instructions and acceptance criteria.

3. **Additional Resources**: Throughout the prework, you'll find links to external resources and documentation that can provide further explanation and practice.

Remember, the goal of this prework is to familiarize yourself with key concepts and prepare you for the intensive learning ahead. Take your time, practice regularly, and don't hesitate to seek clarification if you encounter difficulties.
